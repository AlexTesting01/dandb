Amazon Cart Flow Test Plan

✅ Scenario: Amazon Cart Management
Overall Objective: To validate the core functionalities of adding, verifying, and managing items within the Amazon shopping cart.

Preconditions:
    Setup (Before Each Test Execution):
        Before each test case runs, the shopping cart is populated with two specific items to provide a consistent starting state.

        1. Add "Office Personal Electric Pencil Sharpener, Powerful Stall-Free Motor, High Capacity Shavings Tray, Blue" to Cart:

            - The Amazon homepage is opened.

            - "Office Personal Electric Pencil Sharpener, Powerful Stall-Free Motor, High Capacity Shavings Tray, Blue" is typed into the search bar, and the search is submitted.

            - The first search result for this item is clicked to navigate to its product page.

            - The "Add to Cart" button on the product page is clicked.

            - A confirmation message indicating "Added to Cart" is verified to be present.

        2. Add "Scissors" to Cart:

            - The browser navigates directly to the "Scissors" product page via its full URL: https://www.amazon.com/Scissors-iBayam-Crafting-Scrapbooking-Knitting/dp/B07H3QKN2Z.

            - The “Yellow, Grey, Blue” color option for the "Scissors" is selected.

            - The "Add to Cart" button on the product page is clicked.

            - A confirmation message indicating "Added to Cart" is verified to be present.

    Cleanup (After Each Test Execution):
        After each test case finishes, the shopping cart is emptied to ensure a clean slate for the next test.

            1. The shopping cart page is visited.

            2. All items in the cart are removed by repeatedly clicking the "Delete" buttons until no items remain.

            3. The cart count icon is verified to display "0", confirming the cart is empty.

Test Cases:

    Test Case 1: Verify Both Products are in the Cart
        Objective: To confirm that the previously added "Office Personal Electric Pencil Sharpener, Powerful Stall-Free Motor, High Capacity Shavings Tray, Blue" (identified by its brand, "Bostitch") and "Scissors" are correctly displayed within the shopping cart.
            Steps:

                1. The shopping cart page is visited.

                2. The presence of "Bostitch" text is verified on the cart page.

                3. The presence of "Scissors" text is verified on the cart page.

    Test Case 2: Verify Cart content by Screenshot Comparing
        Objective: To visually verify that the cart items appear as expected, using image comparison against a stored baseline.
            Steps:

                1. The shopping cart page is visited.

                2. The test waits for the page to stabilize and content to load.

                3. A screenshot of the cart content is captured.

                4. This captured screenshot is then compared pixel-by-pixel with a pre-existing baseline image.

                5.The test passes if the visual difference between the captured and baseline screenshot is within an acceptable threshold and diff count.

    Test Case 3: Verify Free Shipping Availability After Adding More Items
        Objective: To validate that the free shipping qualification status updates correctly in the cart when item quantities are increased after setting a specific delivery location.
            Steps:

                1. The shopping cart page is visited.

                2. The global delivery location is updated to a specific ZIP code (e.g., "10001") that is known to enable free shipping conditions for qualifying orders.

                3. Initially, the cart is verified to display a message prompting the user to "get FREE delivery" (implying the order does not yet qualify for free shipping).

                4. Order 3 additional pencil sharpeners.

                5. After the quantity update, the cart is verified to display a message explicitly stating "Your order qualifies for FREE Shipping."
